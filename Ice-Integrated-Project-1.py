# ### Although these findings imply that ESRB ratings can have some effect on sales, it's crucial to remember that other elements like player preferences, game popularity, marketing, and genre can all have a big impact on sales in a given area. Furthermore, the interpretation of these data may be impacted by the fact that the ESRB rating system is largely utilised in North America and that other rating systems may be in use elsewhere.
